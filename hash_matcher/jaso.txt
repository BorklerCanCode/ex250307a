catch2 example works for x86 only
https://github.com/rutura/CMakeSeries/tree/main/Ep023
fails as-is for aarch64 render (makes garbage in terminal)
OR/also until I tie it in to my main.cpp's hash-matcher


same issue with gtest
https://github.com/rutura/CMakeSeries/tree/main/Ep022
fails as-is for aarch64 render (makes garbage in terminal)
OR/also until I tie it in to my main.cpp's hash-matcher

PS
my hash-matcher calls /usr/bin/sha256sum
because using the openssl sha.h was gnarly
some kind of oddness about how ubuntu 22.04
is setup with openssl

not planning on fixing this as timeline and todos are crunched
BUT how badly would you judge a candiate for this work around?
